# mqtt-hikvision
A quick wrapper to feed Hikvision cameras with two way audio into MQTT "hermes" audio support

This was for testing with [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Audio playback (e.g. TTS) definitely worked, audio recording was functional but Rhasspy seemed unable to understand after initial testing.
